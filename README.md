# Call taxi booking system
## Question: 

<pre> Design a Call taxi booking application
        -There are n number of taxi’s. For simplicity, assume 4.
        (But it should work for any number of taxi’s)
        -The are 6 points(A,B,C,D,E,F)
        -All the points are in a straight line.
        -each point is 15kms away from the adjacent points.
        -It takes 60 mins to travel from one point to another(15km in 60 mins)
        -Each taxi charges Rs.100 minimum for the first 5 kilometers
        -Rs.10 for the subsequent kilometers.
        -For simplicity, time can be entered as absolute time. Eg: 9hrs, 15hrs etc.
        -All taxi’s are initially stationed at A.
        -When a customer books a Taxi, a free taxi at that point is allocated
        -If no free taxi is available at that point, a free taxi at the nearest point is allocated.
        -If two taxi’s are free at the same point, one with lower earning is allocated
        -Note that the taxi only charges the customer from the pickup point to the drop point.
        Not the distance it travels from an adjacent point to pickup the customer.
        -If no taxi is free at that time, booking is rejected

        Design modules for

        1)    Call taxi booking
        Input 1:
        Customer ID: 1
        Pickup Point: A
        Drop Point: B
        Pickup Time: 9

        Output 1:
        Taxi can be allotted.
        Taxi-1 is allotted

        Input 2:
        Customer ID: 2
        Pickup Point: B
        Drop Point: D
        Pickup Time: 9

        Output 1:
        Taxi can be allotted.
        Taxi-2 is allotted
        (Note: Since Taxi-1 would have completed its journey when second booking is done, so Taxi-2 from nearest point A which is free is allocated)


        Input 3:
        Customer ID: 3
        Pickup Point: B
        Drop Point: C
        Pickup Time: 12

        Output 1:
        Taxi can be allotted.
        Taxi-1 is allotted
        2) Display the Taxi details

        Taxi No:    Total Earnings:
        BookingID    CustomerID    From    To    PickupTime    DropTime    Amount

        Output:
        Taxi-1    Total Earnings: Rs. 400

        1    1    A    B     9    10    200
        3    3    B    C    12    13    200

        Taxi-2 Total Earnings: Rs. 350
        2    2    B    D    9    11    350
        These were just sample inputs.
        It should work for any input that they give.
        Those who finished both the modules within 3 hours and if it worked for all the inputs they give,
        those candidates were given extra modules to work with.</pre>
